Description: The package can be used when understanding the summary statistics of a dataset. 
The package will return the mean and median of a variable in a dataset if it is numeric. If the 
input data is not numeric, it promptly returns an error stating that the data type is not numeric
and hence, the mean and median of the variable cannot be found.
