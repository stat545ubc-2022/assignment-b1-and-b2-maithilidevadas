**Assignment B1**


**Contents**
This repository contains the files **AssignmentB1.md**, **AssignmentB1.rmd** and **README.md**
In this document we have learnt to create a function and document it using **roxygen2()** syntax. 
We have further used our function to test its functionality across various datasets. The datasets include **penguins from the palmerpenguins package**, **vancouver_trees and apt_buildings from the datateachr package**.
Finally, we have used code from the **testthat()** package to check and validate our function's correctness.
